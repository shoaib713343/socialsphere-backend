Of course. Here is the final, comprehensive PRD and System Design document for our production-grade SocialSphere monolith. You can save this as README.md or PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md in your project's root directory.

PRD & System Design: SocialSphere (Monolith)
Version: 2.2

Date: October 7, 2025

Project: A real-time, feature-rich, production-grade social media application built with a Modular Monolith architecture.

Part 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1.1. Introduction & Vision
SocialSphere is a modern social media platform designed for users to share rich media, interact with content in real-time, and connect through live streaming. Our vision is to build a high-quality, scalable, and performant application that showcases advanced backend engineering practices. This project is designed to be a portfolio centerpiece, demonstrating a deep understanding of performance optimization, real-time systems, advanced security, and professional DevOps workflows, all within a well-structured monolithic architecture.

1.2. Core & Advanced Features (User Stories)
Authentication & Security
As a user, I want to sign up and log in using my email, mobile number, or Google account.

As a user signing up with email, I want to receive a verification link to confirm my address.

As a user signing up with a mobile number, I want to receive an OTP (One-Time Password) via SMS to verify my number.

As a user, I want my session managed by secure access and refresh tokens.

As a user, I want to log out, which should immediately invalidate my session, making my accessToken unusable.

Content & Interactions
As a user, I want to create a post with text, an image, or a video.

As a user, I want to like, comment on, and share posts.

As a user, I want to view a feed of all posts, which should load quickly thanks to server-side caching.

As a user, I want to explore a "Trending" feed, showing posts with the highest engagement.

Rich Media & Real-Time Systems
As a user, I want to discover and watch short-form videos in a dedicated "Reels" section.

As a user, I want to start a live stream that other users can join and watch.

As a user, I want to receive instant notifications via WebSockets when someone interacts with my content.

As a user, I want to engage in one-on-one real-time chat with online status and typing indicators.

1.3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Performance: Cached API responses should be under 50ms. Complex database aggregations should be under 300ms.

Scalability: The code will be structured as a Modular Monolith with a clear separation of concerns (services, controllers, models) for maintainability.

Reliability: The application will use structured logging, centralized error handling, and a comprehensive test suite (Unit and Integration tests using Jest & Supertest).

DevOps: The entire application and its dependencies (Database, Cache) will be fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. A full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions will be implemented for automated testing and deployment.

Part 2: System Design
2.1. High-Level Design (HLD)
2.1.1. Architecture: The Modular Monolith
The system will be a single, deployable Node.js application. The internal code will be highly modular, with each feature (auth, posts, notifications) isolated in its own directory. This provides excellent maintainability while keeping the deployment simple.

Single Backend Service (Node.js/Express): Handles all REST API endpoints and manages WebSocket connections.

Primary Database (MongoDB): The main data store (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

Caching Layer (Redis): An in-memory database for caching API responses and managing the token blacklist.

2.1.2. Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Cache: Redis with ioredis

Real-Time: Socket.IO

Authentication: JWT, bcrypt.js, Passport.js

SMS Gateway: Twilio (or similar)

Media Storage: Cloudinary (or AWS S3)

Testing: Jest, Supertest

Containerization & DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions

2.2. Low-Level Design (LLD)
2.2.1. Database Schema
User Schema: Will include username, email, password, provider, phoneNumber, isPhoneVerified, and the hashed refreshToken.

Post Schema: Will include type (text, image, video), content, mediaUrl, author (ref to User), likes, shareCount, and comments.

2.2.2. Key System Designs
Immediate Logout Strategy (Token Blacklist): On logout, the accessToken's unique ID (jti) will be added to a blacklist in Redis. The authentication middleware will check this blacklist on every request to ensure instantly revoked tokens are rejected.

Caching Strategy (Cache-Aside): The GET /posts endpoint will first check Redis for cached results. If not found, it will query MongoDB, store the result in Redis with an expiration, and then return the data.

Testing Strategy (Testing Pyramid): We will focus on writing comprehensive Integration Tests for all API endpoints using Jest and Supertest, supplemented by Unit Tests for complex, isolated business logic.

2.3. Phased Development Plan
We'll build this ambitious project in manageable phases:

Phase 1: Core Foundation (Complete): Monolith setup, full authentication (email/password, JWTs, refresh, logout, protected routes), and basic text-post creation.

Phase 2: Performance & Rich Media: Implement Redis caching, add image/video upload capabilities to posts, and build the "Get All Posts" feed.

Phase 3: Social & Real-Time: Implement the follow system, a personalized feed, likes, comments, shares, and real-time notifications via WebSockets.

Phase 4: Advanced Features & DevOps: Build the "Trending" feed (MongoDB Aggregation), the "Reels" feature, and the full Dockerization and CI/CD pipeline. Live streaming will be a final, advanced goal.
